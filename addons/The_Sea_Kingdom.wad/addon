name=_"The Sea Kingdom"
description=_"This map has been designed especially for naval invasions. Each player starts on their own Summer island with three port spaces and no gold. There are three Desert islands with gold deposits and one port space each. Every port space on the map is embedded in a terrain configuration that a wise player can use to their advantage in the sea battles that will surely come. Each of the six islands has one artifact."
