descr=_"The British imperium transported huge amounts of criminals to a new continent soon after it was found at 17th. century. The imperial ships abandoned you and all the other criminals it has to this barren, strange new world. Your heroic decision is to bring order to the rows of the criminals and to create your own prosperous country full of life."
hint=_"This is an improved version of the original map I created at around 2013. Lots of changes and balancing have been done to make this map work properly with build 20. I also added landmarks to the map. Enjoy."
